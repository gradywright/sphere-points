# spherepts
A collection of matlab functions for experimenting with different point sets on the sphere.  These include 
minimimal energy points, maximal determinant points, icosahedral points, HEALPix points, and spiral points.
Various plotting routines are also included for visualizing the point sets, as well as other utilities such
as finding K nearest neighbors. 

Please see the tutorials in the docs folder for various capabilities offered by this package.

Please consider adding your own point sets using a similar style to the other routines.
