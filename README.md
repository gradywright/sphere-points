A collection of MATLAB functions for experimenting with different point sets on the sphere. These include 
minimimal energy points, maximal determinant points, t-designs, icosahedral points, HEALPix points, spiral points, and Hammersley points.
Various plotting routines are also included for visualizing the point sets, as well as other utilities such as finding K nearest neighbors. See the tutorials in the [docs](/docs) folder for various capabilities offered by this package.

Consider adding your own point sets using a similar style to the other routines!
